Project Description: Heart Traveller is a 2D Puzzle Platformer designed and coded by Laurent Klein, Lea Fevrier (https://github.com/leatje6299) and Samuel Ding for the first year and second term module Games Project 1. The game is created in Unity and uses created assets by Lea and Music created by a personal friend, Sacha Ewen.

We received the Theme "<3" (Heart Emoji) and we decided to take a more literal approach and decided for a game that takes place within the human body. The player, as a Cell, needs to reach the heart and navigate themselves within this labyrinth, collect Oxygen to survive and defeat bad cells to get through.

Challenges: The biggest challenge in this project was to work in a group. We did manage to communicate well and work well together, but to still keep an overview of the project was new. Nailing down ideas in the initial design phase took longer as we were three people with strong opinions, but the resulting ideas were great. I personally ran into a big challenge with level design and the skill tree.

Lessons Learned: Creating a Upgrade System for the player and Scene Management with having a multi-level game. Using proper communication tools within the teams to increase productivity and quality overall.
